# README FOR RUNNING GUILE FOR WINDOWS

In this directory you will find:

check-guile.log		- Log generated after running the test suite
guild				- Artifact from the build process
guile-config		- Artifact from the build process
guile-snarf			- Artifact from the build process
guile.exe			- The guile application
run-guile.bat		- A batch file for starting guile with the correct paths
run-tests.bat		- A batch file for running the test suite and generate check-guile.log
test-suite			- The test suite directory from the guile source

Guild, guile-config and guile-snarf might be usable on Windows, but you will need
some tools such as awk to use them, and guile must most likely be added to your system PATH.
If you need these, consider running them from an MSYS environment.

## run-guile.bat

This batch file was made for convenience, so you can start guile without installing the
environment variables it needs, or copy the shared libraries into a directory on the PATH.

If you inspect the batch file, you can copy the environment variables from there
and manually add them to the system-wide environment. The batch file is cleverly made
to let you put the guile base directory anywhere you like. As such, this release works
as a freestanding application with no absolute install paths.

## run-tests.bat
Running the tests like you do on Linux is broken because of a path issue either with guile
itself, or with the ./test-suite/guile-test script. As such, this batch file is a workaround
until the issue is fixed.

Some tests in run-tests.bat are commented out. This is because they made the test suite crash
and abort. The remaining tests might still fail, but they fail cleanly and allows the test suite
to continue until the end and print a summary. In addition, some tests
in the ./test-suite/tests directory might have been added after the run-tests.bat script was written.
Manually add the missing ones (if any).
